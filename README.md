HI! YOU ARE CURRENTLY VIEWING AN OUTDATED BUILD OF MY AUTOMATIC TABBING PROJECT. 
FOR A CURRENT BUILD/MVP PLEASE VISIT https://github.com/BaptistChristesen/Tabber---Final---Working
OR EMAIL ME AT CadenChristesen@Gmail.com

THIS BUILD WILL NOT WORK. AS I AM WRITING THIS FILE THE LINKED REPOSITORY IS A ZIP FILE.
THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE XCODE WILL NOT PUSH TO GITHUB DUE TO ERRORS ON MY END OF THINGS.
I APOLOGIZE FOR ANY CONFUSION.

SINCERELY,
CADEN MICHAEL CHRISTESEN
